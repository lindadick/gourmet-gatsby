# Gourmet Gatsby

This will eventually be a Gatsby-based frontend for viewing a Gourmet (https://github.com/thinkle/gourmet) database.
Features might one day include:

* Search by ingredient
* Weekly meal planner (i.e. add to calendar functionality)
* Local storage to track in-stock ingredients and frozen meals
